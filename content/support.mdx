## Getting Started

### What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into focused intervals (traditionally 25 minutes), separated by short breaks. Each interval is called a "Pomodoro."

**The Basic Process:**

1. **Choose a task** you want to work on
2. **Set the timer** for 25 minutes (one Pomodoro)
3. **Work on the task** until the timer rings
4. **Take a short break** (5 minutes)
5. **Repeat** the process
6. After **4 Pomodoros**, take a **longer break** (15-30 minutes)

### First Time Setup

When you first open the app:

1. The timer is set to default values (25-minute work sessions)
2. Tap the **Play button** to start your first Pomodoro
3. Tap the **Settings tab** to customize durations
4. Your preferences are automatically saved
